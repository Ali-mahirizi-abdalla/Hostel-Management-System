# Project Documentation — Hostel Management

Welcome to the project documentation. This folder contains the reference docs for the Hostel Management Django app.

Docs index:

- `overview.md` — High-level description and features
- `setup.md` — Local development setup and environment
- `deployment.md` — Deployment instructions (Render + Docker)
- `architecture.md` — Project structure, models, views and templates overview
- `api.md` — Public endpoints and form behavior
- `models.md` — Data model details and relationships
- `contributing.md` — Contribution workflow and code guidelines

Open any of the files above to read details. If you want me to generate a PDF or host docs as HTML, I can add a simple docs build step (MkDocs) next.
